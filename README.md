## How to Create a Tab Bar with React-Navigation?

#### Intro
Hello everyone and welcome to The Frontier! My name is Israel Machovec, and Iâ€™m a Product Manager at Big Nerd Ranch. In this screencast, I will show you how to use React-Navigation to Create a Tab Bar in a React Native App.

In the example, I created three views, each representing an artist from the popular hip-hop group Migos. Yes, the same guys who brought you "Bad and Bougie" are now represented here in a React Native tutorial.

#### Background

To get started, we assume that you are already familiar with the basics of React Native. I created a new React Native app using the [ create-react-native-app ](#) CLI and [ Expo ](#) and will be showing a preview of the app using the Xcode Simulator.

#### Install React-Navigation

First, we'll need to import React Navigation into our project. Open up your terminal, head to your project folder, and type in the following command.

*__Screen:__* _Opens terminal and types in the following command. Does not press enter._

```
npm install --save react-navigation
```
I've already imported React Navigation into my project, so I'm not going to run the installation again. If you are having trouble with the installation you can check out - [ React Navigation on GitHub ](#).

#### Create Folders

Now that we have installed React-Navigation, we're going to create a few folders where we'll be doing a majority of our work. We'll start by creating a folder called  **App**. Inside of the App folder we'll create a **Views** and **Config** folder. We'll also create an **index.js** file inside the App folder.

#### Create Views

Next, let's create some views so we have something to navigate through. When creating our views, we'll need to make sure we import the following items from React-Native to support out theme:

* ScrollView
* Text
* Image
* StyleSheet

*__Screen:__* _Types in the following into an empty file._

```JavaScript
import React, { Component} from 'react';
import { ScrollView, Text, StyleSheet, Image } from 'react-native';
```  

Since we're here to learn about creating a tab bar, I've created a theme we can copy and paste into our view files. After we paste the theme, we'll still have to edit a few items. Since I'm from Atlanta and big fan of hip-hop music, I decided to make three screens of my favorite Atlanta artists the Migos - Quavo, Offset, Takeoff. Inside of our **Views** folder we'll create 3 files.

* Quavo.js <br>
* Offset.js<br>
* Takeoff.js<br>

*__Screen:__* _Creates 3 files, Copy and paste the theme into the files_

```JavaScript
import React, {Component} from 'react';
import { View, Text, StyleSheet, Image } from 'react-native';

var backgroundImage = require('./Assets/Quavo.png')

class Quavo extends Component {
  render() {
    return (

      <View style={styles.imageView}>
        <View style={{position: 'absolute', left:0, top:0, height: '100%', width: '100%'}}>
          <Image source={backgroundImage} style={{flex:1, height: null, width: null}}/>
          </View>
      </View>
    );
  }
}
const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  textFirst: {
  flex: 1,
  fontSize: 50,
  fontWeight: 'bold',
  textAlign: 'center',
  marginTop: 150,
  },
  imageView: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'flex-end'
  }
});

export default Quavo;
```
Now that we've copy and pasted the theme into the files, we'll need to go back and edit a few items.

#### Creating the Navigation

Now that we have everything set up, we can start building our navigation. We'll head over to our **Config** folder and create a **Navigation.js** file. In this file, we are going to be importing TabNavigator provided by react-navigation and we'll also be importing our view files.

*__Screen:__* _Adds the following to the navigation file._

```JavaScript
import React from "react";
import { TabNavigator } from "react-navigation";

import Quavo from '../Views/Quavo';
import Offset from '../Views/Offset';
import Takeoff from '../Views/Takeoff';
```

Next, we'll set up our navigation using TabNavigator. The first item in our TabNavigator will define what is displayed on the screen.

*__Screen:__* _Adds screens to the navigation file. Shows the display name example._

```JavaScript
import React from "react";
import { TabNavigator } from "react-navigation";

import Quavo from '../Views/Quavo';
import Offset from '../Views/Offset';
import Takeoff from '../Views/Takeoff';

export const Tab = TabNavigator({

  Quavo: {
    screen: Quavo,
  },
  Offset: {
    screen: Offset,
  },
  Takeoff: {
    screen: Takeoff,
  },
}

})
```

We'll finish up with the navigation file by adding some custom styling to the tab bar.

*__Screen:__* _Adds styling to the navigation file._

```JavaScript
import React from "react";
import { TabNavigator } from "react-navigation";

import Quavo from '../Views/Quavo';
import Offset from '../Views/Offset';
import Takeoff from '../Views/Takeoff';

export const Tab = TabNavigator({
  Quavo: {
    screen: Quavo,
  },
  Offset: {
    screen: Offset,
  },
  Takeoff: {
    screen: Takeoff,
  },

}, {
  tabBarPosition: 'bottom',
  swipeEnabled: true,
  tabBarOptions: {
    activeTintColor: '#f2f2f2',
    activeBackgroundColor: "blue",
    inactiveTintColor: '#666',
    labelStyle: {
      fontSize: 22,
      padding: 12
    }
  }
});

```
For more information on styling you can visit the React Navigation documentation at https://reactnavigation.org

#### Import the Navigator

Next we are going to import our Tab Navigator into our **./App/index.js** file. We named our exported class **'Tab'** and will use that name to render the file.

```JavaScript
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { Tab } from "./Config/Navigation";

export default class App extends Component {
  render() {
      return( <Tab /> );
  }
}

```

#### Importing the index.js File

Finally, well need to import our **'./App/index.js'** file into our root level **App.js**

```JavaScript
import App from './App/index';
export default App;

```
#### Wrapping it Up

Now you can restart your app and view our Tab Bar.
